Objective:
The objective of this Python utility is to fetch records from an Elasticsearch index, perform metrics calculations for the current-month end, as well as for each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for each ZT (Zone-Time) domain field, and calculate metrics for the overall category-class level. The utility will then write the final metrics results into a Kafka topic for consumption by Logstash, which will subsequently store the data in an Elasticsearch index.

Overview:
This Python utility automates the process of fetching records from an Elasticsearch index, performing metrics calculations, and storing the results for further analysis. It utilizes Elasticsearch, Kafka, and Logstash for seamless integration. The utility calculates metrics for different time periods, ZT domain fields, and overall category-class levels, and writes the results to a Kafka topic for consumption by Logstash, which then stores the data in an Elasticsearch index.

Dataflow:
1. Connect to the Elasticsearch index and establish a connection.
2. Fetch the required records from the Elasticsearch index.
3. Perform metrics calculations for the current-month end and each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for each ZT domain field and the overall category-class level.
4. Write the final metrics results to a Kafka topic.
5. Logstash consumes the data from the Kafka topic.
6. Logstash stores the consumed data in an Elasticsearch index for further analysis.

Functionality:
1. Connect to the Elasticsearch index: Use Elasticsearch Python library to establish a connection with the Elasticsearch cluster and access the desired index.
2. Fetch records: Utilize Elasticsearch Python library to retrieve the necessary records from the Elasticsearch index.
3. Perform metrics calculations:
   - Calculate metrics for the current-month end using Python date and time libraries.
   - Calculate metrics for each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for each ZT domain field using Python data manipulation and aggregation techniques.
   - Calculate metrics for the overall category-class level using appropriate algorithms and formulas.
4. Write final metrics results: Utilize the Kafka Python library to publish the calculated metrics results to a Kafka topic for consumption by Logstash.
5. Logstash integration: Logstash consumes the data from the Kafka topic using its own Kafka input plugin.
6. Store data in Elasticsearch index: Logstash uses its Elasticsearch output plugin to store the consumed data in an Elasticsearch index for further analysis.

Tools Used:
1. Python: The utility is implemented using the Python programming language.
2. Elasticsearch Python library: Used for connecting to the Elasticsearch cluster and fetching records.
3. Kafka Python library: Utilized for writing the final metrics results to a Kafka topic.
4. Logstash: Consumes data from the Kafka topic and stores it in an Elasticsearch index.

Input:
1. Elasticsearch index details: The utility requires the Elasticsearch index name or location to connect and fetch the records.
2. Metrics configuration: The utility needs a configuration file or settings specifying the metrics calculations to be performed.

Output:
1. Calculated metrics results: The utility generates metrics results for the current-month end, each quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) for each ZT domain field, and the overall category-class level.
2. Kafka topic: The final metrics results are written to a Kafka topic for consumption by Logstash.
3. Elasticsearch index: Logstash stores the consumed data in an Elasticsearch index for further analysis.

Scheduling Details:
The Python utility can be scheduled to run periodically using tools like cron jobs or task schedulers. The scheduling frequency can be set based on the desired intervals for metrics calculations and data updates. By scheduling the utility to run at specific times or intervals, the metrics data can be kept up to date and seamlessly integrated with the downstream systems.
