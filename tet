We have successfully implemented the hypervisor change, ensuring both SNOW and VOP dashboard metrics are in sync. However, four DBI instances were updated today and removed from the payments platform ZT domain mapping. These changes will be reflected in the VOP dashboard tomorrow, as it processes data with a one-day delay.
