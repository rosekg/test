Subject: Request to Add In-Laws to Family Floater Mediclaim

Dear Team,

I would like to add my in-laws to my family floater Mediclaim policy.

Both of them have diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and hypertension. My mother-in-law also has a pre-existing disease (PED) and has been hospitalized several times in the past 1.5 years.

Do I need to submit any documents related to her PED for the Mediclaim nomination?

Kindly explain the process in detail.

Thank you.
